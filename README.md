### Plugin Configuration

The plugin can generate more detailed snippets and descriptions. Use [the components configuration file](./docs/cli.componentconfigfile.plugins.md) add the plugin configuration shown as below.

- useFullSnippet: Generates a distinct snippet for all combinations of the component selectors
- useFullDescriptions: Generated descriptions will show implemented interface names

.zeplin/components.json
```json
{
    ...
    "plugins" : [{
        "name": "@zeplin/cli-connect-angular-plugin",
        "config": {
            "useFullSnippet": true,
            "useFullDescription": true,
